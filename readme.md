libGDX degen
============

This is a degenerate version of libGDX which I built for reduced native code (increasing speed and reusability)
The crowning jewel is the libgdx-degen.gdx.math module which should be general-purpose once I fix the damn thing.

With our without the Android SDK this sucker will build just fine as a pure maven project.
It will have to scrape a whole libGDX distribution from Google Code when it does this - but I'm working on that.
